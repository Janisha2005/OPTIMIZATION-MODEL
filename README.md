## Overview of the project
### Project: SUPPLY CHAIN OPTIMIZATIONA
### Objective:
**The objective of Supply Chain Optimization is to design and manage supply chain operations efficiently to minimize costs, maximize profits, or achieve a balance between multiple objectives. Using Linear Programming (LP) with the PuLP library, we aim to model and solve optimization problems related to transportation, production, inventory management, and resource allocation.** 

### Key Activities: 
**Loadthe CSV file:**

Load the supply chain data to extract parameters such as costs, capacities, demands, and other constraints.

**Define the problem:**

Formulate the optimization problem as a linear programming problem.

**Set up decision variables:**

These represent quantities such as the amount to ship from suppliers to warehouses or warehouses to customers.

**Define the objective function:**

Typically, minimizing the total cost of transportation.

**Add constraints:**

Include supply limits, demand requirements, and possibly other constraints like maximum capacities.

**Solve the problem:**

Use PuLP to find an optimal solution.

### Technologies Used:
**Python:** Programming language

**Pandas:** Used for data manipulation

**pulp:** Used for LpProblem, LpMinimize, LpVariable and lpSum

**matplotlib:** Used for visualizations
